# Hello, I am Saikat (pronounced Shoikot).
[こんにちは、私はショイコットと言います。]
I love all kinds of science.
But I am trying to get better in Programming.
I love low level programming, graphics programming and C++.
I love making different tools with C++ 
but 3D/graphics programming is my jam.
I am trying to write a renderer 
with DirectX12, OpenGL and Vulkan support.
Using lots of Dynamic Libraries and DI.
My main targeted platform is Windows 
but I might try to support Android as well, idk.

A lil bit more about myself.
I love both dogs and cats.
Want to own a Shiba and a British Shorthair.
I really love to know about history.
While still on that topic,
I consider myself a self proclaimed linguistic.
I love learning new human languages as well as their culture.
I find Kanji or Chinese characters really interesting.
Oh and even though I love literally all things science,
I favor Cosmology more.

## Thank you very much. [ありがとうございました。]
