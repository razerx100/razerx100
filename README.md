# 初めまして、私はショイコットと言います。私のGitHubにようこそ。

I love everything science.
I am trying to be a better programmer.
I love low level programming, graphics programming and C++.
I love making different tools with C++ 
but graphics programming is most fascinating.
Currently I am trying to make a game engine 
using DirectX12 and Vulkan.
The main targeted platform is Windows 
but I might try to support Android and 
(some Window Managers) 
Linux as well later down the road, idk.

Now a little bit about myself.
I love music. I mostly listen to all kinds of Metal and
Japanese Pop. Though Japanese Pop only,
I absolutely despise most English Pop music 
except few
old ones, which I have grown up with.
I love both dogs and cats.
I want to own a Shiba and a British Shorthair.
I really love learning about history.
While still on that topic,
I consider myself a language enthusiast.
I love learning new human languages as well as their culture.
I can express myself in Bengali and English.
But I am not very good at talking to other people.
I'm also learning Japanese and can make simple conversations. Though I am getting better at Japanese at an alarming rate, might I say xD.
I find Kanji really fascinating [面白い].
I love Cosmology the most among all things science. I would really love to see humanity as a spacefaring civilization before dying.
I would also like to visit Earth's moon and Mars one day.
