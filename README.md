# 初めまして、ショイコットと言います。僕のGitHubにようこそ。

I love science. 科学が大好き。
I am trying to be a better programmer.
I love low level programming, graphics programming and C++.
Currently I am dabbling in DirectX12 and Vulkan.

A little bit about myself:
I love music. I listen to all kinds of Metal and
Japanese Pop. Emphasis on Japanese Pop;
I don't like western Pop except a few old ones.
I love dogs and cats. Don't like reptiles.
I want a Shiba and a British Shorthair.
I love history.
I also love learning about Languages and linguistics.
I can express myself in Bengali and English.
But I am not good at talking to other people.
I'm learning Japanese.
I find Kanji really fascinating.
I love space and Cosmology a lot. I would really love to see humanity as a spacefaring civilization before dying.
I would also like to visit Earth's moon and Mars one day or maybe even farther into our Solar system.
