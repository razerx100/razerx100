# Hello, I am Saikat (pronounced Shoikot).
[こんにちは、私はショイコットと言います。]\
I love all things science.
Currently though, I am trying to get better at Programming.
I love low level programming, graphics programming and C++.
I love making different tools with C++ 
but 3D/graphics programming is my jam.
I am trying to write a renderer 
with DirectX12 and Vulkan support.
Using lots of Dynamic Libraries and DI.
My main targeted platform is Windows 
but I might try to support Android and (some Window Managers) Linux as well, idk.

A lil bit more about myself.
I love music. I listen to all kinds of Metal and
Japanese Pop. Japanese Pop only,
I absolutely despise most English Pop music except few
old ones, which I have grown up with.
I love both dogs and cats.
Want to own a Shiba and a British Shorthair.
I really love learning about history.
While still on that topic,
I consider myself a self proclaimed linguistic.
I love learning new human languages as well as their culture.
I can express myself perfectly in Bengali and English.
But my pronunciations in English aren't very good (yet). 
I'm trying adopt British accent.
I'm also learning Japanese and can make simple conversations.
I find Kanji fascinating [面白い].
Oh and even though I love literally all things science,
I love Cosmology the most.

## Thank you very much. [ありがとうございました。]
