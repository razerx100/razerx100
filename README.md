# Hello, I am Saikat (pronounced Shoikot).
[こんにちは、私はショイコットと言います。私のGitHubにようこそ。]\
I love all things science.
Currently though, I am trying to get better at Programming.
I love low level programming, graphics programming and C++.
I love making different tools with C++ 
but I find graphics programming the most fascinating.
I am currently trying to write a renderer 
with DirectX12 and Vulkan support.
Using lots of Dynamic Libraries and DI.
My main targeted platform is Windows 
but I might try to support Android and (some Window Managers) Linux as well, idk.

A little bit more about myself.
I love music. I listen to all kinds of Metal and
Japanese Pop. Japanese Pop only,
I absolutely despise most English Pop music except few
old ones, which I have grown up with.
I love both dogs and cats.
Want to own a Shiba and a British Shorthair.
I really love learning about history.
While still on that topic,
I consider myself a self proclaimed linguistic and polyglot xD.
I love learning new human languages as well as their culture.
I can express myself perfectly in Bengali and English.
But I am not very good at talking to other people.
I'm also learning Japanese and can make simple conversations. Though I am getting better at Japanese at an alarming rate might I say xD.
I find Kanji fascinating [面白い].
I love Cosmology the most among all things science. I would really love to see humanity as a spacefaring civilization before dying.
I would also like to visit Earth's moon and Mars one day.

## Thank you very much. [ありがとうございました。]
