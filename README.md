# Hello, I am Shoikot. [こんにちは、私はショイコットと言います。]
I love science in general. All kinds of science.
But I myself am trying to specialize in Programming.
I love low level programming, Assembly and C++.
But asm is too painful, so C++. I love doing all
kinds of stuff with C++ but mainly I do 3D programming.
I love DirectX12 ❤️ and am trying to make a decent
3D engine with DirectX12. Though I've plan to
do a Vulkan implementation later down the road.
And maybe someday a full fledged Game Engine xD.
## Thank you very much. [ありがとうございました。]
